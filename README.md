# Ind_Study
Any code that I have or work in my independent study class is going to be here so I can make changes and import the codes to whatever device I'm using.

Most of the code is related to post-processing off VASP calculations. As of now, I use vaspkit.1.5.0 to process the VASP files, and then use my code to read in the data from vaspkit. With these codes we calculate the effective mass and plot the band structure.
